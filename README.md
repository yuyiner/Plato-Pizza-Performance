This dashboard visualizes the performance of Plato Pizza in 2015, providing insights into the company's sales and customer behavior. By clicking on the sales for each month, users can explore the sales performance for that month and view the most popular pizza during that period. The data reveals that the sales in July and November show a steady increase, which can be attributed to the high order volume on July 4th and Thanksgiving Day/Black Friday respectively. This highlights the importance of analyzing transactional data and leveraging this information to improve operational efficiency and increase sales.

The dashboard provides an easy-to-use interface for visualizing the transactional data of Plato Pizza, which can help the company make data-driven decisions to optimize their menu offerings, marketing campaigns, and operational processes. By leveraging these insights, Plato Pizza can better meet the demands of its customers and drive growth.
